# Managed-stack CLI recipes

Load this file when the active run uses a confirmed managed stack (`manager_status == "confirmed"`) and needs `gh stack` command recipes. Soft-depend on the CLI: if `gh stack` is missing or exits unavailable (e.g. code 9), surface a clear residual — do not invent managed membership from topology.

Always non-interactive. Prefer JSON/view probes and explicit branch names; never rely on interactive prompts. Substitute `<tracking-remote>` with the stack branches' actual tracking remote (often `origin`, but may be `upstream` or a fork remote) — never hard-code `origin` when SKILL.md already resolved a different tracking remote.

## After an owned push on the active layer (dependents exist)

```bash
gh stack rebase "<first-open-dependent-branch>" --upstack --no-trunk --remote <tracking-remote>
gh stack push --remote <tracking-remote>
```

Starting at the first dependent excludes the active target from the cascading rebase. Quote the branch name — git branch names may contain shell metacharacters. On conflict: `gh stack rebase --abort`, then surface a needs-human / stack-sync residual.

## Discover order / next open layer

```bash
gh stack view --json
```

<!-- bukerov-local-patch: ce-no-merge-authority — deleted the whole "Land one prefix (only under `posture:stack-land`)" section (merge + sync recipe and its post-land transition). The owner performs merges; this skill only ever prints the command. -->

## Forbidden on managed stack members

```bash
gh pr merge …
```

Use `gh stack merge` only. Under `posture:target` and `posture:stack-ready`, print the exact merge command when reporting ready-as-next; do not execute it.
